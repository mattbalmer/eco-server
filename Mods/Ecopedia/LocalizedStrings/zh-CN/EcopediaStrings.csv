1;银行组件是创建和管理[Bank Accounts]的地方。公民可以为自己创建多个帐户，也可以与其他公民共享帐户。帐户也可以分配给[Titles]和[Demographics]。
2;帐户用户可以使用该帐户执行交易（添加和删除资金）。

客户经理可以更改经理列表和用户列表中的用户，重命名帐户并执行交易。在高级设置中，您可以将帐户设置为游戏俱乐部帐户。

游戏俱乐部帐户可以接收和支付税收资金，在收取税收和计算个人财富时将被忽略。要进行此设置，您必须具有由[Elected Title|Elected Titles]分配的游戏俱乐部银行特权。
3;银行组件用于创建和管理银行帐户
4;合同公告板允许公民发布和接受[Contracts]和[Work Parties]，从而允许公民之间执行强制劳动和其他协议。
5;订立合同
6;在发布合同时，可以根据需要制定任意数量的条款，每个条款都可以制定为描述所请求的工作。必须满足每一项条款合同才会被认定为完成。

当“自动接受”被选择时，系统会自动检测到合同的完成。例如，如果一份合同被设定为在两点之间修建一条道路，执行该工作的承包商可以在其侧边菜单中打开该合同，并按下“工作完成”，这将触发检测工作是否确实完成。如果是，合同将按协议交付并自动结束。

“自定义条款”是一种特殊条款，允许玩家用语言描述他们想要做的事情。如果一个合同包含这样的条款，它必须由客户手动批准(自动接受此时不可用)，因为自动检测不能确定何时完成。

当自动检测未启用时，如果承包人认为任务已经完成，他们就可以点击“任务完成”，然后承包人就会接受或拒绝完成任务。没有自动接受的合同要求公民之间有更多的信任，因为不能保证承包商会诚实地接受完成的工作。建议公民在这些情况下使用[Reputation]作为确定声望的一种手段。

合同有一个固定的时间限制，这个限制需在制定合同时确定。此外，可以将合同设置为可重复进行——当启用此功能时，每次接受一个合同时，重复计数器将减少1。

合同有效时，为合同提供的任何款项都会保存在特殊的托管帐户[Bank Account|Bank Accounts]中。 如果合同成功完成，则该款项将转移给承包商，如果失败，则将退还给客户。 承包商也可以收取押金，该押金将由第三方保管，并在成功完成后退还给承包商，或者在失败时退还给客户。

7;工作小组
8;
[Work Parties]也可以张贴在合同公告板上，允许创建可由其他多个公民完成的任务，而不是仅由两方之间达成协议的合同。在发布工作组之前，公民必须在其拥有的手工桌子上开始工作指令。

发布工作组后，劳工可以在合同公告板中加入该项目。默认情况下，任何人都可以以劳动者的身份加入工作组，但是可以为每个人加入的个人角色或一般要求设置要求。选中“将角色扩展为“满员””后，将在填补所有角色后自动创建新的劳工栏位。

在设置所需的工作时，工作组的发布者可以决定雇用劳动力，资源或两者兼而有之。向工作组捐款的任何公民都将根据他们提供的工作量获得一定比例的付款。通过为工作组中的特定工作分配额外的权重，该工作将获得更高的付款份额

9;
工作组有多种支付方式，每个工作组也可以使用多种支付方式。

-使用[Currency]作为支付方式时，可以使用“随用随付”的选项，它将按劳工的贡献度来支付，而不是在合同完成时一次性付清。 

-使用[Reputation]作为支付方式时，工作组完成后所有参与工作的公民将平分声望值。

-使用[Research]作为支付方式时，所有参与工作的公民将在工作组结束后立即发现该技术。仅当工作组正在创建研究书时，或者提供工作组的公民在发布工作组时其库存中有研究书时，才可以将研究作为支付方式。 

-授予[Title|Titles]作为支付方式时，发布合同的公民必须是所提供头衔的管理员。所有达到最低贡献值的公民将被授予新头衔。访问类型确定他们是否成为头衔管理员或头衔所有者。

10;合同公告板组件允许公民发布或接受合同以及工作组订单
11;信用组件允许公民为他们拥有的对象上的所有交易设置货币和银行帐户

选择[Bank Accounts]时，公民可以选择已被授予访问权限的任何帐户（在[Bank Component]中执行）。默认情况下，将选择公民的个人帐户。

可以在信用组件中选择世界上任何一种[Currencies|Currency]。这将指定对某物品上发生的任何交易时采用的货币（例如[Store|Store Component]将接受此处设置的任何货币）。

当为商店中的货币选择为无时，无需货币就可以进行直接交易。

Objects with a [Crafting Component] can define a fee for authorized citizens to use them. The settings in the Credit Component will determine what currency that fee is charged in and what account the funds are deposited to.

13;The Credit Component allows citizens to set the bank account and currency for transactions on an object.
14;契据销售组件允许公民购买和出售[Property]
  
15;
通过访问[Real Estate Desk|Real Estate Desk Item]，公民可以为其契据创建清单，并查看其他市民的清单。可以从任何房地产服务台查看所有发布的列表。

创建清单时，业主设置价格以及使用的[Currency]。所有收入都将进入所选的[Bank Account|Bank Accounts]。

所有者可以指定要分发的物品，每件物品的数量以及公民必须玩多久才能获得领取资格。
  
25;允许所有者发起慈善捐赠，向新公民提供免费物品，促进前期发展。
26;铸币厂组件允许公民创建由资源担保的[Currencies|Currency]。
27;
在[MintItem]创建货币时，必须选择一种物品作为担保，以及消耗没单位物品生成的货币数量。通过设置担保物，可以将可能的货币总量限制为所提供担保物的数量，避免大量新货币冲击市场从而保证稳定性。选择的担保物会影响这一点，因为更稀有物品通常更难获得，因此可以提供更高的稳定性。

每个担保物对应的货币数量是永久性的，因此在选择担保物时请多加注意。货币铸造后，铸币厂将会与创建的货币绑定，即便铸币厂被移动。

在[Authorization Component]中被授予使用权利的公民可以使用铸币厂组件铸造其他货币。可以将货币铸造到所有者选择的目标[Bank Account|Bank Accounts]中，也可以铸造给任何[Bank Component]中公民可以访问的银行帐户中。

A store owner can link specific containers in the [Storage Component] to pick which items are considered part of the store's inventory. By default, all nearby storage containers are linked to the store when it is first placed.

When creating a Sale List, only the price needs to be set. The inventory for a Sale List is determined automatically by the availability of items in the linked storage containers.

When creating a Purchase List, the price and Max to Buy quantity for each item must be decided. If the Max to Buy quantity is left at zero, the store will continue to purchase items until the linked containers are full. If a Max to Buy quantity is specified, citizens can sell that item until the linked storage contains that amount.

For tools with durability, a minimum durability to buy/sell can be set, and only items of that durability or higher will be eligible for trade via the store.

The Deed displayed here is simply a link to the deed of the [Property] which the object is on (or the deed associated with the [Vehicle|Vehicle Component] if it is one).

Authorized Consumers can be listed here, either as specific people, [Titles], or [Demographics].  Anyone listed can interact with the object without having full control.  A store, for example, will allow citizens with consumer rights to buy and sell there, but only citizens with full rights to the property may change what is for sale, or move the store itself.

All placed objects have authorization components.
  
63;Allows citizens to set the access rights of a given object.
64;Beds allow citizens to accelerate time when all citizens are using it simultaneously (or offline).  
  
(This feature is disabled by default on dedicated servers to prevent accelerating time when users are offline, but can be enabled by a server administrator.)
65;Allows sleeping in single-player servers or servers where sleep is enabled.
66;Components related to industry.
67;
    The Crafting Component is used to [Craft|Crafting] items, add resources or labor, and cancel existing projects. When contributing to a [Work Party|Work Parties], the Crafting Component can be accessed by citizens who have joined the work party.
  
68;Crafting Items
69;
After selecting an item and quantity to craft, resources and labor are required to start the project. These resources can be added manually (placing them directly on the crafting table) or by linking a [Storage Component] that contains them.

Citizens with a related [Specialty|Specialties] require less calories to add labor. Some projects required skilled labor from a citizen with the corresponding specialty. This reduction is applied after the work order is started so citizens of various skill level can contribute to the same work party.

By adding an upgrade in the [Modules Component], work orders on a crafting table will have reduced crafting time and resource costs.

If a project is cancelled early (by right clicking the order), the resources will be refunded but the spent labor will be lost.
  
70;Adding Labor
71;
For every unit of labor needed, [Calories|Nutrition] are consumed. After a work order is started, citizens can add labor by pressing the 'Work' button in the Crafting Component. 

Once a project is started, labor can quickly be added from outside the Crafting Component by right clicking on a crafting table. When adding labor in this way, holding down 'Ctrl' will add 5x the normal amount of labor. Holding down 'Alt' will add all available calories.
  
72;Tagged Ingredients
73;
Some recipes use Tagged Ingredients that can accept similar items as inputs. For example, an item may specify it needs 'Rock', and will accept any type of rock with that tag ([GraniteItem], [BasaltItem], etc).
	
Tagged ingredients will be consumed automatically, so there is no need to create separate orders using the different ingredients.
  
74;Parent Recipes
75;
Some recipes are part of larger group of recipes, known as Parent Recipes. When crafting one of these recipes, a citizen may select a specific variation to produce. The number crafted will be the quantity selected for the parent recipe.

By default only recipes that have available resources will be displayed. By checking 'Show All', all possible variations will be displayed.
  
76;The Crafting Component is used to craft items and add labor to projects.
77; The Module Component allows citizens to insert upgrades into their [Crafting] tables. After inserting an upgrade, work orders on that table will have reduced resource costs and crafting times.
78;Using Upgrades
79;
Upgrades come in five different quality levels. A level 1 upgrade decreases the resource cost and craft time by 10%, with each progressive level adding an additional decrease.

Crafting tables accept different types of upgrades. Early tables accept 'Basic Upgrades', while later tables require 'Advanced Upgrades' or 'Modern Upgrades'. Each tier of upgrade has five different quality levels, with the highest quality level being a Specialty Upgrade.

Some recipes have costs using Static Ingredients. Static ingredients are not affected by the resource cost reduction, but the recipes that contain them still get a reduction for crafting time. 
		
80;专业升级
81;
The highest level of upgrade can only be crafted by a citizen who has reached the maximum level in their chosen [Specialty|Specialties]. Unlike other upgrades, these upgrades recieve an additional cost reduction when crafting recipes using the specified profession.

Some specialties have different tiers of upgrades that correspond to different crafting tables. For example, [CarpentrySkill] has the [CarpentryBasicUpgradeItem] for the [CarpentryTableItem] and the [CarpentryAdvancedUpgradeItem] for the [SawmillItem].
  
82;Allows citizens to upgrade their crafting tables.
83;
The Pipe Component allows a citizen to check the status of an object’s smog output, water usage, and sewage flow.  
  
84;Smog Output
85;
By checking the Smog Output tooltip, a citizen can find additional information about the current object’s pollution output and the world’s [Pollution] levels.
	
Pipes can be used to redirect the flow of the air pollution. The pipes containing the Smog Output can have multiple inputs but must have only one open end, outside of all rooms, and above the object.

Objects that emit smog pollution only pollute when the object is active. 
	
86;Water and Sewage
87;
Objects with a Water Input and pumps with a Water Output connect through a system of pipes. Water pipes systems can have multiple inputs for water pumps and multiple outputs for each object with a water demand.	

By checking the water tooltip in the Pipe Component, a citizen can see exactly how much water an object is producing or consuming. If there is not enough water being produced, objects will start to become inactive.

Pipes containing Sewage Output function similar to water pipes, but the [Sewage] they contain is a source of ground pollution. After [Waste Filters|Waste Filter Item] are invented, the sewage output can be piped into to a filter to mitigate the ground pollution.
	
88;The Pipe Component allows a citizen to check the status of an object’s smog output and water usage.
89;The Power Component is used to check the status of local power grid. It is also used to check the consumption of objects that require fuel to operate.
90;燃料
91;
Objects that consume fuel will can have fuel input here, and each may require different types of fuel to operate. The tooltips for the accepted fuel contain a list of specific items that can be used to fuel the object. Fuel can also be added from the [Storage Component].

While operating, an object consumes fuel every second, measured in Watts (W). Each type of fuel contains a different amount of potential energy, measured in Joules (J). For every 1 Watt needed per second, 1 Joule of energy is consumed. Fuel is not consumed while the object is inactive.
  
92;Energy Stats
93;
There are two types of [Power] that can be used by an object, Electric and Mechanical. The power grid displays the type and availability of the needed power for this object. If there is not enough power supply to match the power demanded, objects will become inactive.

Power generators that consume fuel become inactive if there are no nearby objects demanding power. There is no need to turn them on and off to conserve fuel.
  
94;The Power Component is used to check the supply and demand for power and fuel.
95;The Repair Component allows citizens to repair tools at a [ToolBenchItem].
96;
After inserting a broken tool, the repair costs will appear. Advanced tools can be repaired for less resources by citizens with the corresponding [Specialty|Specialties]. The resources used can be manually added by a citizen or taken from a linked container in the [Storage Component].

The owner of a Tool Bench can allow other citizens access to repair their own tools for a fee set in the [Credit Component]. When offering tool repair to the public, consumer rights must be given in the [Authorization Component].
  
97;Allows citizens to repair tools.
98;
The Status Component allows citizens to see the requirements for an object to be active, and which of those requirements are met. If an object causes [Pollution], the status component also shows the lifetime pollution production for that object.
	
99;Object Status
100;
Each condition in the Status Component must be satisfied before an object can be active.  Some examples of conditions include:

- Being contained in a valid [Room|Rooms]

- Having enough [Power]

- A working [Sewage] system
	
101;Status Indicator
102;
When interacting with an object with a Status Component, citizens can quickly see the status of the object by checking the status indicator in the top left corner. A green circle means an object is active while a red circle means it is inactive.
	
103;Displays if an object is active or inactive and why.
104;The Storage Component is used to manage the inventory of storage containers and link them to objects that need storage.
  
105;Managing Storage
106;
Inventory can be moved between containers by dragging stacks of items from one container to another.

Holding down the 'Shift' key while dragging items will move all stacks of the same item between containers. Right clicking a stack of items will allow a player to divide a stack into smaller quantities. Holding down ‘Ctrl’ when clicking a stack of items will split the stack in half.

Some storage containers, like a [StockpileItem], can contain any type of item. Other storage containers, like a [StorageChestItem], can only contain non-carriable items.
  
107;Linking Storage Containers
108;
通过选中容器的复选框，可以将对象链接到存储组件中的容器。链接后，对象就可以访问容器中的所有项目，并且可以使用容器进行存储。链接存储容器时，将首先使用存储组件中最顶层的容器进行存储。可以通过单击并拖动列表中的存储显示来更改顺序

124;经济包括公民的所有资源使用，贸易和技术进步。
125;通过使用[Contracts]，Eco中的公民可以在两方之间创建贷款和债券协议，从而自动跟踪资金的利息支付和到期日。贷款和债券是新公民与拥有更多财富的长期公民合作的一种好方法，既可以使双方受益，也可以促进社会进步。如果公民借贷，则供款方会给他们钱，并期望他们支付利息。如果公民购买了债券，他们便向要约方支付钱款，并期望他们可以付息。可以使用[Laws]来构建对贷款违约的罚款，方法是关注“贷款/债券违约”触发器。然后可以采取行动，例如收回财产或施加其他处罚和罚款

126;金融是管理货币以促进进步。
127;每个参与者都可以影响任何其他参与者的声望，而后者又可以用作章程，合同等中的因素，可以查询公民声望并根据价值确定特权（或特权）（或特权）。要设置公民的声望，请将鼠标悬停在其姓名上，然后在工具提示中单击其声望列表（可在[Current Citizens]页面上找到所有公民的列表）

128;声望由网络乘数修改，网络乘数的计算方式是：给每个给您正面声望的公民+1，给每个给您负面声望的公民-1。这样，与只关注少数几个公民相比，帮助许多公民并获得广泛的声望变得更加有益。相对声望是另一个价值，它仅考虑您对自己给予正面声望的公民。

130;研究创造了可共享的新知识，从而释放了新类型的产品和能力。它是在您制作技能手册的[ResearchTableItem] 上进行的。创建后，技能书可用于创建无限数量的技能卷轴，这将为使用该技能卷轴的公民解锁专业知识。每个技能卷轴都是一次性使用的消耗品，可在使用它的任何人中解锁新的[Specialty|specialties]，然后必须通过[Skills|skills overview] 系统进行升级以声明其权利。获得新的技能卷轴还会使公民受益于一套[Property Claim Papers|Property]，这使他们可以在获得技能时索取更多土地。技能书是最难创建的一些内容，市民通常需要协作以获取制作它们所需的所有各种资源和劳动力。因此，研究项目特别适合[Work Parties]，因为公民可以使用它们来共享创建它们所需的工作以及完成时的知识奖励。
  
131;研究创造了可共享的新知识，释放了新类型的产品和能力。
132;与您的同胞进行交易在Eco中至关重要，因为每个玩家都有一套[Specialties]，他们可以在与其他擅长职业的其他公民进行交易时最有效地做出贡献。 -可以在[Store Component] 设置交易，列出您想要的不同商品的买/卖价格。然后，公民可以在不存在的情况下异步地向您购买和出售商品。 -劳务交易可以通过[Contracts] 和[Work Parties] 进行，允许玩家在商定的条件下进行付款工作。这也可以异步执行。 -货币交易可以在[Currency Exchange|Exchange Component] 进行，其中列出了不同货币交换的买/卖价格。 -[Transport] 促进了贸易，在您的新兴文明中心之间建立运输基础设施将极大地提高贸易能力。 -贸易受游戏俱乐部[government overview] 设定的[Taxes] 的约束，这可以促进或减少某些贸易的价值。

133;具有不同能力和拥有不同商品的公民之间的贸易是经济的支柱。

地球上巨大的生物多样性和丰富性可以大致归类为生物群落。生态中的生物群落是世界上属于降水和温度特定范围的区域。由于这些模拟的物理差异，不同种类的微生物，植物，真菌和动物能够在不同的生物群落中生存和繁衍。 Eco中的每个生物群落都拥有一套独特的资源，供玩家发现和提取，以建立并促进他们的社会。每个生物群落内的生活社区之间通常都有相互依存的关系，而这些相互联系是与栖息地，饮食和土壤联系在一起的，而这些联系又由于存在的气候和地球资源而产生。生物群落是全球生态系统内的生态系统，有时在生物群落内还有进一步的划分或“亚生物群落”，例如高沙漠，高草草原，冻原上的冰川冰层或海洋海岸。生物群落和亚生物群落是连续的单元，其中许多单元对它们可以位于附近或内部的生物群落有限制。随着时间的流逝，由于玩家的影响而导致的环境变化，生物群落有可能被彻底重塑。气候变化可能会改变生物群落的边界，使社区流离失所-一些物种将生存和适应，而另一些物种则不会如此灵活。建筑，耕作，采矿和伐木等活动对土壤的直接置换和其他栖息地破坏也将对生物群落内的物种产生不同程度的影响。动植物物种不仅可能喜欢特定的生物群落，而且更喜欢亚生物群落的某些部分，如果这些高度局部的地区被改变或破坏，这将意味着更大的影响。弹性和适应性物种将能够随着其改变而跨越生物群落边界，但是这些相同的物种可能会在引入它们的新生物群落中成为对更敏感的动植物的威胁。

生态系统本身就是生态系统的终结，它的持续繁荣是游戏的主要目标，同时也伴随着经济发展。也就是说，生态系统始于胜利状态，玩家必须使用其资源而不会使其陷入失败状态，这将意味着对人类的破坏。无论服务器是否在游戏中，Eco中的生态系统都在连续模拟中运行，只要服务器在运行，它就一直处于活动状态。每个模拟的动植物都在生长，消耗食物并繁殖。它是玩家必须建立自己的社会的唯一材料来源，而提取它们的过程将对其产生极大的影响。砍伐森林可能会破坏生物的栖息地，使它们灭绝。矿山尾矿可能污染附近的河流和湖泊，使依赖它的农场中毒。玩家在“生态”游戏中采取的行动会影响他们的环境，玩家需要了解他们所拥有的影响才能蓬勃发展并阻止流星。不能将生态系统保持在原始，未受破坏的状态。流星确保选择也将导致生态系统的破坏。为了保护它，公民必须从中受益，建立一个有权制止流星的社会，同时也要有制止其在此过程中不破坏生态系统的约束力。

农业提供了一种方法，可以将对人类最有用的植物品种带入全球，并提供全球范围的粮食供应。农业也可以集中在对其他工业用途有用的植物上，例如用作潜在可再生能源的生物燃料。农民将需要注意其土壤的资源和健康，避免消耗和污染。像[CompostFertilizerItem] 这样的肥料和像[SoilSamplerItem] 这样的监测土壤资源的方法将是保持农田生产力的重要工具。随着社会对食物和燃料需求的增加，各种车辆，存储技术和更强大的手动工具将使玩家能够扩大他们的农业活动。农业是生态中的一项重要活动，我们希望在发展中不断发展壮大。平衡和存储将是开始进行农业改良的核心部分，因为我们确保生态社会能为农民带来适当的需求以推动技术发展，并确保存在存储对象和机械来满足这些需求。农业本身有许多可能的改进和扩展，其中包括发展和改良种子和生物，使其更具生产性或对污染物或其他环境因素产生抵抗力。

生态土壤含有能够使植物生长和繁衍的营养素：任何给定类型的过多或过少都会改变天然植物和农场植物的产量和生长速度。随着植物的生长，它们从土壤中吸收养分，死后将其返回，使世界进入自然平衡状态。玩家通过收割，砍伐森林，采矿或引入污染从土壤中去除养分的方式将植物从环境中清除，从而影响这些变化。玩家可以在自己的土地上使用肥料重新引入养分或修改现有比例。随着我们增加动物对植物层的依赖性，我们可以使生态系统的那些部分进一步影响土壤，因为食用植物的物种也可以从土壤中去除养分。另一个可以考虑的问题是表层土壤在Eco中的存在方式：目前，表层土壤是纯粹的化妆品，并与该地区的生物群落相关，但是与下面的致密粘土和污垢相比，在每个生物群落中，表层土壤都是一种独特而宝贵的资源。

162;手工开采
163;
To mine ore, first you must locate it. Ores in Eco are each hosted in particular host rocks, so learning which rocks have the type of ore you want and then digging near rocks of those type is a good way to start. Use a [WoodenShovelItem] or better to dig away soil from the surface or start digging into a hill from the side. Once you hit rock you want to go through, you'll need to use a pickaxe like the [StonePickaxeItem] to break it. When breaking rocks with the pickaxe, sometimes you'll break off a larger piece of rock that needs to be hit again to break into pieces small enough to pick up. It's a good idea to pick up rock as you break it, and stack it elsewhere for use, preferably in a [StockpileItem] or vehicle you're using to transport your ore like a [WoodCartItem].

164;Mineral Processing
165;
Once you have collected a large amount of metal ore, you'll need to process the ore before you can craft metal products with it. This is a dirty and expensive process, and optimizing it and the byproducts from it will be an ongoing matter of consideration. The three main steps of mineral processing are:

Comminution: Comminution means to crush the rock into smaller sized particles which can be further processed. Crushed rock of the type the ore is hosted in is the main byproduct of this process.
Concentration: Concentration is a way to separate the desired metals in an ore rock from the waste rock. This process is never perfect, and inevitably results in a large output of waste rock which still contains traces of freed metals. This waste rock with traces of heavy metals is known as [TailingsItem]. [CopperOreItem] and [GoldOreItem] require chemical leeching and wet processing to separate from their host rocks, and thus produce more polluted and volatile [WetTailingsItem] during the concentration process.  
Smelting: Once you have precious ore concentrate, you can at last smelt it into metal products like [IronBarItem] at a [BloomeryItem] or using a more advanced smelting technology. 

166;动植物的生存系统为人类的生存提供了手段。
167;
As citizens burn fuel to cook or generate power, smelt metals, process sewage, and engage in countless other necessary industrial activities, a common byproduct is pollution. Pollution is any substance that can act as a contaminant or poison when introduced back into the environment. In Eco there are many sources and several varieties of pollution, some of which are more potent than others. Heavy metals can contaminate soil, affecting available nutrients and the health of plants and animals living on and in it. Water can spread contaminants rapidly and increase the size of their impact. Air pollution can pour invisibly or obviously from a stove or a power plant, adding to greenhouse gasses and impacting the air quality, as well as fall back down into the ground as acid rain. 

To ensure the survival of ecosystems and preserve resources like soil and water, players will have to manage and contain the sources of pollution their civilization creates. In some cases, spills or deadly concentrations will be inevitable, and then remediation and storage may be the only option to return the land to an unharmed state. 

168;地面污染
169;
Once released into the soils and water table, ground pollutants are not easy to stop or remove. Various materials in Eco are sources of ground pollution, most notably tailings from mining and garbage from crafting and other player activities. Pollution spreads as a gradient that increases in concentration with time if the source of pollutants remains or increases. When the source of pollutants is removed from contact with the ground, ground pollution spreads and dissipates with time.

170;Air Pollution
171;
Many player activities can create harmful emissions which if released into the atmosphere act as air pollution. Crafting at objects with CO2 outputs or running generators with them contributes to local and global pollution levels. Over long periods of time, global CO2 levels contributes to a global warming effect which affects sea level in turn. There are natural sinks and intakes for some pollutants like CO2 such as forests.

Concentrations of air pollution will fall back to the ground as acid rain, which we simulate using the air pollution and local rainfall quantities. 

172;Water Pollution
173;
Water is a medium through which pollution spreads more quickly and further, rushing downstream and blossoming out in lakes or oceans. Pollution in the water generally comes from nearby ground pollution sources, but also may be entering the water via the acid rain mechanic in areas with lots of air pollution. 

Removal of the source is the only way to currently stop water pollution, but clean-up and remediation strategies are features we are considering for the future.

174;Containment
175;
In many cases, there is no perfect solution to deal with polluting materials. Space must be made to store various pollutants, and pollutants must be stored in a way that prevents them from re-entering the surrounding environment. This is a challenge that should be key to environmental management of industry in Eco. Currently tailings mechanics require deep underground storage; this will be improved with further development. 

Containment mechanics are the forefront of features we want to improve related to the Pollution group of features in Eco. Players should be using containment to deal with the vast quantities of tailings and garbage that their societies produce.

177;Consitutional Articles define how things happen in the government: who can pass laws, set taxes, change the rules, etc.  It can also define certain actions as needing an election, by specifying an [Election Process|Election Processes] inside them.  

Constitutional Articles can be added in two places.  On a [CapitolItem], you can add up to three, and on [AmendmentsItem] you can add up to another 10 more per item.

Defining the rules of the government is very important for keeping it a stable, society-supporting structure.  Governments can be granted a great deal of power over the world with laws, and there's a danger of this power being abused.  By setting a system of checks and balances, citizens can design a government that can undergo a number of changes, including changes of leadership, while maintaining the power to effect positive changes in the world.

  Demographics are classes of citizen, created in the government. These can then be used anywhere you can specify a citizen (permissions, laws, etc).

For example, citizens could define a demographic 'Lumberjacks', which would only contain users with a logging skill level of 3 or more.  Then, a law could be created that only permits 'Lumberjacks' to cut down old-growth trees.

Demographics are defined at a [Census Bureau|CensusBureauItem].

Demographics can also have wages set on them. Wages are paid periodically as long as a citizen remains within the demographic.

183;Districts are created by players at a [ZoningOfficeItem] and can be used as areas that are specified by laws.

A district is a selected area of land, non-contiguous, which players can adjust at will.  Districts are contained in District Maps, and there can be multiple district maps in the world. However, within each district map, no districts may overlap.

Districts can be used to designate where actions are allowed with laws. A law can be created, for example, that prevents creating chopping trees in a 'Protected Zone' district.

184;A defined section of land, which can be referenced by laws and other systems.
185;Elected Titles are government officials that can be assigned permissions to manage government policy. These titles can be used anywhere you can specify a citizen (permissions, laws, etc.). 

Elected titles are created at a [GovernmentOfficeItem]. Several conditions can be set when defining an elected title:

  - An [Election Process|Election Processes] with term limits for title holders
  - The number of citizens who can hold the elected title at the same time
  - Requirements to stay in office once elected to the title
  - A successor who takes over the position if a title holder is removed from office

While creating an elected title, the following permissions can be assigned:

  - Setting the tax rate at a [TreasuryItem]
  - Access to spend the funds in the Treasury bank account
  - Government banking privileges to create government bank accounts that are exempt from personal wealth calculations
  - The ability to place a global map marker to notify citizens of a point of interest

Elected titles can be assigned wages that are paid periodically to the citizens that hold the title.
  
186;Elected Titles are government officials that can be assigned permissions to manage government policy.
187;Citizens can define new types of elections at a [BoardOfElectionsItem], and each election process created there can be used for various changes to government and leadership.

[Civic Articles] can reference Election Processes in order to designate actions that require an election.  [Elected Titles] created at a [GovernmentOfficeItem] must specify an Election Process by which new members get elected.

Each Election Process can define a different set of voters, vetoers, timings, percent needed to win, etc.  Using different types of elections, citizens can design their government to have different seats of power. For example, they can define a powerful Title that must be elected by the general population but can be impeached by them as well. 

188;Defines how an election takes place.
189;Elections can take two forms:
  
    - Elections of Officials . These are elections of [Elected Titles] which give specific powers to a citizen.
    - Referendums.  A yes-or-no vote that will determine if a specific civic action should be taken.

Elections are started at a [BallotBoxItem], where citizens can perform a number of civic actions.  Depending on what [Civic Articles] are available, these actions may or may not require an election; if they do, the citizen will have the option to start one immediately.

Elections can have a number of settings determined by their [Election Process|Election Processes]. This will state who can vote, who can veto, how long the election lasts, what percent is needed to win, etc.  Multiple types of elections can be created for different purposes. For example, a representative government could be created with some elections only allowing elected officials to vote, while most citizens vote only in elections for representatives.

 - Issue a one-time [Tax|Taxes]
 - Provide a payment to citizens from the [TreasuryItem]
 - Change the [Property] owner of existing property

Depending on what [Civic Articles] are available, these actions may or may not require an election. Some civic articles state that only [Elected Titles] may perform Executive Actions.

    The government is created by citizens, piece by piece, growing their power and capability alongside the power of the populace.  The parts of the government are:
  
196;[Constitution]
Before any other aspect of government can be created, a Constitution must be created at a [CapitolItem]. It determines the how the government operates via civic articles.

197;[Civic Articles]
A constitution contains civic articles which define how the government functions: who can do what, and how.  They can be created at a [CapitolItem] on a new constitution or added to an existing constitution at an [AmendmentsItem] table.

198;[Laws]
Laws determine rules and processes that all citizens are compelled to follow.  A [CourtItem] can hold up to 3 laws. 

199;[Elections]
Elections will be started automatically when making changes that require them, as determined by the constitution. They can have many effects (changing laws, electing leaders, performing executive actions).

200;[Election Processes]
An election process determines how elections work: who can vote and veto, how long they last, what majorities are required, etc. A [BoardOfElectionsItem] can hold up to three election processes.

201;[Elected Titles]
An Elected Title is a government position that can be given special privileges. A [GovernmentOfficeItem] can hold one elected title.

202;[Demographics]
A demographic defines a group of people according to specific rules. This group can then be used in other aspects of the government.  A [CensusBureauItem] can hold up to three demographics.

203;[Districts]
Defines an area of land which can be referenced in laws and other places.  A [ZoningOfficeItem] can hold up to three district maps.

204;[Executive Actions]
An executive action is a one-time operation that can be performed to enact changes to society. They are performed at an [ExecutiveOfficeItem] by users given privileges from the constitution (typically elected titles).

209;Laws are the means by which the government makes changes in the world, to achieve goals of the populace.

Laws are created by placing a [CourtItem], and depending on the [Civic Articles] available may require an election to pass.  Each law is created with a list of causes and effects, and when the cause happens the effect will be activated.  This allows a lot of flexibility in how the laws work, and they can cover many areas; from taxation to regulation to paid out funds incentivizing activities.

Many ‘Cause’ choices will provide context about the citizen who triggered it, where it was triggered, etc. These ‘context’ properties can be seen in the Cause tooltip, and are available for specifying data in the ‘Effects’.  For example, an effect may tax the specific player who chopped down a tree
  
210;Cause-and-Effect rules designed by citizens and enforced automatically in order to achieve societal goals.
211;For the good of the people, or at least the enrichment of the government, taxes can be levied on many actions in Eco.
  
Treasury Taxes
At a [TreasuryItem], Taxes can be set on a variety of actions:
 - Sales Tax.  Tax applied to the sale of goods at a store.
 - Crafting Fee Tax. Tax applied to the fees taken from sharing your crafting station.
 - Contract Tax. Taxes taken from payments made through contracts and work parties.
 - Direct Transfer Tax. Taxes taken from transfers between players.
 - Self Direct Transfer Tax. Taxes taken when transferring to an account you have access to (to optionally protect against tax avoidance loopholes).

Only a citizen holding an [Elected Title|Elected Titles] who has been granted the right to ‘Set Taxes at the Treasury’ may adjust these rates.  All taxes taken from these settings will be stored in the special ‘Treasury’ bank account.  Allocation may be made out of this special bank account into others through commands on the treasury.

Law Taxes
Taxes can also be set through [Laws], which can have their amounts and destinations determined dynamically. The bank account they are placed in can also be determined, allowing for the funding of specific funds for specific purposes, stored in bank accounts accessible to a limited number of people only.  Using the law system, these taxes can be very specifically targeted and adjusted based on the actions that are happening.

For example, a 'Minister of Transportation' Elected Title position could be created, having sole access to a Transportation Fund [Bank Account|Bank Accounts].  A law could then be created to tax the production and trade of fuel, with proceeds going into the Transportation Fund, where the currently elected Minister of Transportation can use them to fund new roadbuilding [Work Parties].

212;Tax can be taken from the economy to fund publics works project as well as incentivize or disincentivize economic activity.
213;Titles are used for designating a group of users, then referencing that group in other things like permissions.  They are different from [Demographics] in that Titles are specified directly by citizens, while the citizens within a demographic are automatically defined based on a citizen-defined condition.

There are two types of Titles available:

 - Regular Titles. These can be created and managed by anyone at a [RegistrarItem].  There, the citizen can set which other citizens can assign the role (managers) and which are occupying the role.
 - Elected Titles. These titles can only be elected (or appointed) and are created at a [GovernmentOfficeItem].  The properties of the government office determine what kind of [Election] is needed to elect the given position.  Elected Titles can only be left if they are forcibly removed from office, if they resign (both performed at a [BallotBoxItem], or if their term ends as defined in the position’s term limits.

Elected Titles give a lot of flexibility in defining the governance of a world, and privileges can be tied directly to these accounts. For example, a tax law could be created that taxes vehicle usage and puts it into a fund that only the Elected Title ‘Minister of Transportation’ has access to. If there is another election for that position and it changes leaders, then the former citizen will automatically lose access to the account.

By setting requirements on the Elected Title, you can ensure the continued good governance by citizens holding office. For example, you could place a requirement that all occupants of a given office are part of the 'Active' demographic may hold it. If an office holder becomes inactive, they will then automatically be removed from office and a specified successor put in their position.

Titles can also have wages set on them. Wages are paid periodically as long as a citizen continues to occupy the title (and the payer has funds).
  
214;Positions which can hold one or more citizens.  Used for designating permissions and paying wages.
215;A citizen cannot thrive without proper shelter, and together with your [Nutrition] your Housing value will determine your [Experience] multiplier.  The better your house’s materials and furnishing are, the higher your experience multiplier.  

Additionally, many objects require houses and utilities to operate. The housing system consists of the following parts:
 - [Rooms]. A room is a fully contained space, and many objects require being place inside a room to function.
 - [Property]. Citizens can claim individual plots of land which they then can control access to.
 - [Power]. Many items require a power source to operate, and generated power can be shared among many citizens.
 - [Sewage]. Certain items require a sewage system of pipes, pumps, and wastewater treatment.

216;Your housing (along with your diet) determines your skill gain.
217;Many objects require power to function, and as your society progresses the types of power will progress as well.
  
Early on, most power will come from calories expended by citizens.  Local-power sources can also be built such as [Waterwheels|Waterwheel Item], powering only the immediate vicinity.  When technology progresses to electricity, power can then be generated centrally, allowing groups to form together to power towns and cities as a group rather than having to individually setup power sources (community projects like this are a great fit for using the [Taxes] system to fund them, and [Contracts] and [Work Parties] to get them built).
  
Many types of power generation exist, and each has different fuel needs as well as environmental impact.  The building, fueling, and operation of power plants can become a major [Pollution] source as technology advances, and citizens will need to carefully regulate the types of power used and how pollution is handled to prevent an ecological catastrophe.
  
218;Many objects require power to function, which can be generated in a variety of ways.

223;Objects can have their access rights set separately from the land they are on, to allow consumer access to objects that are on private land.  These settings are determined in an [Authorization Component].  

224;凭证
225;On the deed, citizens can add and remove parties that may access the land (place or remove blocks).  The owner can also be changed by clicking the gear beside the owner name.  Note that both [Demographics] and [Titles] can both be given ownership on a deed, including [Elected Titles]. Structuring a government this way can allow only elected officials to have certain access rights to land.
226;Citizens and governments may own property and determine the access rights of them.
227;Rooms are enclosed areas protected from the elements where all holes to the outside world are filled with walls, doors and windows.

You can see the details about a room in a panel on the right side of the screen while you’re inside one stating its information. Many types of objects have Room Requirements and will take up space in their room, and require the materials of the room to be a specific quality.  Your housing value is also affected by the quality of the room materials.  This means a brick a house for example will provide much more benefit than a dirt hovel.


Furnishings and Room Types
By claiming land and building rooms on it, you will begin to gain additional experience, which persists even when offline.  Adding additional types of rooms and furnishings for those rooms will increase it further.  Each type of furniture is associated with a kind of room: Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, or General (displayed on the tooltip of the item).  The room type will be determined by whichever category you have the highest contribution of furnishings from.  Each room will have its value calculated by summing all the furnishings inside it.

Repeats of the same furniture inside a room or repeats of the same room type in a house will give you diminishing returns; that is, you will still get housing points for them, but not as many as the first.   Eventually the point gain will be negligible, and it won’t be worth it to add any more of that type of furniture or room to the house.  For example, your 12th bathroom is going to add much less value to your house than your first one.

Room Material Quality
The average tier of the room material will also determine your housing value, by setting a soft cap.  Once your room value has exceeded the soft cap for the room, then you will get diminishing returns for additional housing points.  When this happens, it may be time to renovate the materials of the room.

228;Rooms protect you and your equipment from the elements, providing skill points and allowing equipment to function.
229;
Many industrial and housing objects require sewage support to function.  Typically, this means requiring water as an input, and an output for waste water.  Every object that has a [Pipe Component] will need a sewage connection.

Sewage systems are created by connecting a [MechanicalWaterPumpItem] or [ElectricWaterPumpItem] to a water source, and then building Pipes between the different objects that need supplying.  On the waste side, pipes will take the waste water from the object to either dump it into the environment (producing [Pollution] at the exit point), or process it at a [Waster Filter|WasteFilterItem], which will generate [Compost|CompostItem] from the wastewater.

Pipes will automatically connect to any adjacent pipe block of the same type.  To make sewage systems with different pipes in close proximity, use different materials of pipes.

230;Certain items require sewage to supply water and remove wastewater.
231;Components related to industry.
232;As you gain experience in Eco you will be able to unlock new specialties and new abilities within those specialties. There are two types of experience you will gain, Character Experience and Specialty Experience.  Both are increased by your Experience Multiplier.

Character Experience
Character Experience is your background learning rate, how fast you are gaining knowledge and abilities.  It is constantly going up, even when you’re offline.  Each real-day, you will gain Character Experience at the rate of 1 * your experience multiplier.  When you reach a level up, you will gain a new specialty unlock, represented by a star.  Each level up will require more and more character experience to gain, so it is very difficult to have more than a few specialties.

Specialty Experience
Specialty Experience is your skill at a specific ability, and rather than going up constantly, it only goes up when you perform actions related to that specialty, such as crafting or performing labor.  Like Character Experience, it too is multiplied by you Experience Multiplier. Along the left side of the screen, you’ll see icons displaying how much experience you’re gaining when you perform actions, and you can click these to get a closer look at the level ups for that specialty.
Some level ups will allow you to unlock talents, which give specific bonuses related to the skills they’re in.

Experience Multiplier
Your Experience Multiplier (or XP Multiplier) is a personal value representing your health and support system, and it determines how fast you learn new skills.  It is determined as a sum of your [Nutrition] and [Housing|Housing Overview] values.  Because it affects both your character and specialty experience points, you’ll want to keep it as high as possible by eating the nutritious food and having a well-furnished house.


233;There are two kinds of experience in Eco: Character Experience (gained by food and housing) and Specialty Experience (gained by performing actions in a specialty).
234;
Your Experience[Experience] is determined by your nutrition and housing[Housing|Housing Overview], and the more nutritious the food you eat the faster you will gain [Experience].  The healthier you are, the faster you advance.

There are four nutrients represented in foods: Protein, Fat, Vitamins, and Carbs.  By adding up the average of each of these nutrients in all the food you’ve eaten in the last 24 hours, your experience multiplier is determined.   This means that if you eat junk food (low nutrients) it will affect you for 24 hours before it has passed through your body.

Additionally, a balance multiplier is applied, giving an additional 0% - 50% of your total based on how equal the nutrients are in your body. If you have exactly 25% of each nutrient for example, you will gain an extra 50% skill.

Depending on the difficulty settings for this server, a ‘skill gain multiplier’ may also be set which increases it further.

Finally, a base skill gain value is added to the total. This ensures that even when you’re totally starving, you’re still gaining at least some skill.  You can see all these calculations for yourself in the tooltip for food in the bottom left UI.

Calories
Calories, unlike nutrients, are spent when you perform work, and when you run out of calories you’ll be unable to work until you eat more.  Calorie usage can be greatly reduced by upgraded tools and leveling-up skills.
All food provides both calories and nutrients, so while gaining calories from food you’re also determining your skill multiplier, so watch that diet.

235;Nutrition, alongside housing, determines how fast you gain experience.
236;Central to a thriving economy is the ability to specialize and trade, thereby working more efficiently than if you attempted to do everything yourself.  Achieving a successful society depends on successfully accomplishing both.  
    
    A citizen's skills give them unique abilities and enhancements, which allows them to [Trade] with other citizens having different skills in the economy. As you gain [Experience], you can unlock new [Specialties] and level-up existing ones.  The experience you gain is multiplied by you [Nutrition] and [Housing|Housing Overview].    
  
237;The skill system allows citizens to specialize in specific trades.
238;
    Specialties are unlocked as you level-up from Character [Experience].  Each specialty (represented with a star) will unlock new abilities you can use.

Professions and Specialties
[Professions|Profession Overview] are simply groupings of skills, and don’t serve any other purpose besides storing similar skills together.
Specialties are each contained under a profession and require two steps to gain.

1. First, you must read a skill scroll for the skill.
2. Next, you must spend a star to take the specialty.

Once you have chosen the specialty, you gain the base-level abilities associated with it. As you perform actions related to that specialty, you will gain Specialty [Experience], leveling up the specialty and unlocking new abilities to it.
You can see the spread of specialties that other citizens have chosen on the skill selection dialog, and it is often a good idea to choose specialties that other players have not chosen or leveled up. This will allow you to each perform your own specialties and [Trade] with each other for a net gain.


239;Specialties can be gained by collecting Character Experience, and each specialty will unlock new unique abilities.
240;Food, along with housing, is essential for increasing your skills.
241;Carpenters are specialist at working with wood.

  - [LoggingSkill] allows citizens to chop trees faster while expending less calories. In addition, this specialty is used to produce [HewnLogItem] which are the primary building material for the carpentry profession.
  - [CarpentrySkill] allows citizens to produce wooden furniture and [Boards|Board Item]. By using a [SawmillItem], citizens with this specialty can produce [LumberItem] and higher quality furniture.

  - [PaperMillingSkill] allows citizens to refine wood pulp into [PaperItem]. Paper is used for some specialty furniture.
	
242;Carpenters are specialist at working with wood.
243;Chefs cook high quality food that enables citizens to gain experience faster. Using the raw food produced by farmers and hunters, chefs create food that is high in nutrients. As technology advances, the chef specialties cook progressively higher quality food.
  
  - [CampfireCookingSkill] is the entry level Chef specialty that uses a [CampfireItem] to prepare better meals than the basic charred food produced by non-chefs.
  - [CookingSkill] is the second step in the Chef profession that uses a [CastIronStoveItem] to produce higher quality meals.
  - [BakingSkill] is an alternative to Cooking that uses [FlourItem] to produce baked goods.
  - [AdvancedCookingSkill] is a high-level Chef profession that produces the highest tier of food.
  - [AdvancedBakingSkill] is an alternative to Advanced Cooking that uses [YeastItem] to produce high quality baked goods with [LeavenedDoughItem].
  
244;Chefs cook high quality food that enables citizens to gain experience faster.
245;Engineers use the materials created by other professions to lead the way in technological advancement. The vehicles they produce greatly improve the capacity for trade and the speed at which citizens work. The crafting tables they produce are used by a variety of professions to create high-end goods. Being an engineer requires frequent interaction with other professions as engineers are unable to produce the primary inputs necessary for crafting.
  
-[BasicEngineeringSkill] allows citizens to produce roads and carts to help with transportation. In addition, basic engineering creates the crafting tables necessary to process and smelt ore.
-[MechanicsSkill] allows to citizens to create early motorized vehicles, like a [SteamTruckItem]. Mechanics provides the first source of electric power to help enable tecnological progression.
-[IndustrySkill] allows citizens to create advanced vehicles, like an [ExcavatorItem], to quickly collect large amounts of natural resources.
-[OilDrillingSkill] allows citizens to use a [PumpJackItem] to collect [PetroleumItem] for use in fuel and a variety of industrial projects.
-[ElectronicsSkill] is a high-end engineer specialty that uses expensive ingredients to produce the most advanced materials needed for modern crafting projects. In addition to this and providing a source of green electricity, electronics is used to craft the [LaserItem] needed to save the world from the meteor.
  
246;Engineers are master inventors who produce vehicles and other advanced products for other citizens.
247;
    Farmers are specialists in agriculture. The crops they produce are a primary source of the calories needed for citizens to perform work.
 
  - [FarmingSkill] allows citizens to create seeds out of produce to help create large farms.
  - [FertilizersSkill] allows citizens add nutrients to soil and test soil conditions with a [SoilSamplerItem].
  - [GatheringSkill] allows citizens to harvest more produce from both wild plants and human-created farms.
  - [MillingSkill] allows citizens to process produce in a [MillItem] for use by chefs in more advanced recipes.
  
248;Farmers are specialists in agriculture.
249;
    Hunters are specialists at efficiently hunting animals and preparing meat for use by chefs. The two hunter specialties are closely linked as the animals hunted must be processed before it can be used by a chef. 
    
  - [ButcherySkill] allows citizens to process animal carcasses into prepared meat for chefs. The pelts and hides they create can be used for clothing and other crafting projects.
  - [HuntingSkill] grants citizens bonus damage when hunting animals and allows them to approach animals at a closer distance without causing them to run.
  
250;Hunters are specialists at hunting animals and preparing meat for chefs.
251;Masons are specialists at mining and working with stone. They provide a valuable source of building material and furniture for homes. The ore they collect is used by Smiths to smelt metal bars.
  
  -[MiningSkill] allows citizens to expend less calories while mining stone and ore. Miners also process the collected ore and concentrate it to be used for smelting.
  -[MasonrySkill] allows citizens to produce [MortarItem], a primary ingredient for most mason building materials. The [MortaredStoneItem] they produce is a great source of early housing material.
  -[PotterySkill] allows citizens to craft [BrickItem] building material and furniture out of [ClayItem].
  -[GlassworkingSkill] allows citizens to create [GlassItem] and later [FramedGlassItem]. Glass is a nice supplemental buildling material and is used in a variety of industrial projects.
  -[AdvancedMasonrySkill] is a high-level mason skill that produces the finest quality Ashlar Stone building material and furniture.
  
252;Masons are specialist at mining and working with stone.
253;Professions are groups of similar [Specialties] that unlock new crafting recipes and provide abilities like reduced calorie usage when crafting or using a tool. Within each profession is a group of similar specialties.
  
Below is a list of all professions and the corresponding specialties. Citizens can choose to focus on one profession or learn specialties from a variety of professions.
  
254;Professions grant citizens special ability and the ability to craft advanced items.
255;Smiths smelt concentrated ore into metal bars that can be used by a variety of professions. In addition, Smiths create superior tools that help citizens work more productively.
  
- [SmeltingSkill] are specialists at making the metal bars that make up the foundation of technological advancement. The iron tools they create provide significant benefit over the early stone tools.
- [AdvancedSmeltingSkill] allows citizens to further refine iron bars into [Steel|SteelBarItem] for use in industry and high-tier building materials. Citizens with this specialty can use the steel they create to even more modern tools than the iron tools created by basic smelting.
  
256;Smiths smelt ore into metal bars and create advanced tools.
257;All citizens are survialists in the world of Eco. 
  
Experience in [SelfImprovementSkill] is gained anytime a citizen levels up another specialty. Self-improvement has two main benefits. As citizens progress, they will have increased carry weight capacity and a larger stomach capcity for extra calories. In addition, less calories are consumed when using hammers, shovels, and drills.
  
258;Survialists expend less calories when using basic tools and have increased carrying weight.
259;Tailors work with cloth to make clothing and high-end furniture for other citizens. Unlike other professions, the Tailor profession has only one specialty.
	
[TailoringSkill] allows citizens to create [ClothItem] for use in crafting projects by a variety of professions. The clothing tailors creates provides citizens with special bonuses. For example, a [BigBackpackItem] has a higher maximum weight limit than the starter [BasicBackpackItem].
	
260;Tailors work with cloth to make clothing and high-end furniture for other citizens.
261;Any object containing a Vehicle Component can be mounted and interacted with in a variety of ways, providing a number of benefits.
  
Many vehicles require [Power|Power Component] to operate and each have their own [Storage|Storage Component]. Building infrastructure around the world will greatly enhance your [Transport] capabilites as many vehicles require roads to operate.
262;  
- Transportation: Vehicles like the [WoodCartItem] can transport goods and people from place to place. As technology progresses, more advanced vehicles become available with faster movement speeds and higher carrying capacity at the cost of creating pollution

- Excavation: The [ExcavatorItem] and [SkidSteerItem] can quickly move large quantites of dirt and rock. This will greatly increase the speed of [Mining] and allow areas of land to be quickly cleared for new construction projects.

- Contruction: The [CraneItem] can quickly perform large-scale [Building] projects. The crane has a much larger building range than a citizen who is building with a hammer and can access large amounts of storage.

264;Vehicles can be used for performing a variety of tasks.
265;
In Eco, players harvest food initially from the wild biomes around them. Plants ripe for the opportunity to harvest sustainably abound. Wild food sources can serve as a supplementary renewable resource, but will quickly crash if taken advantage of. Some plants will be useful for more than just food-- they may provide chemical compounds that can be found no-where else, or the raw materials needed for textiles and clothing.

Different plants require different tools to harvest, such as a shovel, or a scythe. Other species can be picked by hand without a tool. Similarly, some plants are killed when they are harvested, and others will simply re-grow the picked fruits if they continue to grow and be healthy. 


  
266;动植物的生存系统为人类的生存提供了手段。
267;
Animal species are inhabitants of the world in Eco that vary greatly in terms of possible use as resources. Some species make for excellent sources of meat and food like milk, where others may provide useful byproducts like wool, leather, tallow, or bone meal. But animals also vary greatly in terms of their resilience and adaptability to impacts on their populations, habitat, and food sources. 

Through hunting, players can use various traps and hand tools to harvest wild animals directly from the ecosystems they live in for use. Hunting can also serve as a way to control or cull excessive populations of animals. Hunting will be an important but not strictly necessary activity for players especially earlier on in order to meet the appetite of a large society. 

Hunting an animal is only the first step in making the most use out of it. Butchery advancements will allow players to process and use animals for a large variety of animal products. Collaboration with other professions like cooks and tailors will unlock many nutritional, industrial, and even cultural uses for animals and their products, not all of which need be obtained through hunting. However, if a particular animal product becomes popular in the economy, care will have to be taken to avoid destructive pressure on a species. Hunting is often the final blow to an endangered species whose products become more and more valuable as they become more and more rare.

To get started with hunting, you'll need to craft a [WoodenBowItem] and some [Arrows|Arrow Item]. More advanced bows will make it easier to hit your target quickly. Keep in mind that animals can be killed more quickly with a well-aimed shot, and that it may be easier to hunt some animals based on the time of day.

    Once you've covered your basic needs, it's time to think about how you want to contribute to the joint project of society, and your profession is how you do that.
  
271;

Each profession has a number of [Specialties] beneath it which will unlock special abilities. Because citizens can only have a limited number of specialties, a good approach is to take different specialties and then [Trade] between each other.  In the skills window, you can see how many citizens have chosen each profession and look for the most-needed skills, choosing those to focus on.
  
272;
    Check out the [Profession Overview] for a tour of the different options.
  
273;(Note: the skills dialog is hidden until later in the tutorial.  It can be made visible by completing the tutorial or skipping it.)
 
274;A world with a range of professions can trade for mutual benefits.
275;
    The [Government|Government Overview] of Eco is run by individual citizens, and the quality of governance is fully dependent on how those citizens participate.

    There are a number of ways to participate in the running of the government, including:

    - Founding the government by creating a [CapitolItem] and [Constitution].
    - Defining civics objects including [Districts], [Demographics], [Elected Titles], [Election Processes], and [Amendments|Constitution].
    - Running as a candidate for an [Elected Title|Elected Titles], giving special powers assigned to it by the constitution.
    - Enacting [Laws] after attaining the privilege to (defined in the constitution).
    - Enacting [Executive Actions], with privileges also defined in the constitution.
    - Voting in [Elections] for [Elected Titles] and other civic actions.
    - Debating laws with the use of [Data], presenting arguments to your fellow citizens arguing for one choice over another.
  
276;
    Each of these options are available at a variety of locations which must be constructed by citizens. The current government can be viewed by selecting the Government icon in the action bar and hovering over each section will specify where the civic object is defined.
  
277;Your civic duties are the many different ways you can interact with the government.
278;To bring a society through the ages to the peaks of technology, a thriving [Economy|Economy Overview] is needed, and by participating in it citizens can both help progress society as well advance their own abilities and wealth.
 
Participating in the economy takes place through [Trade] of both goods and services.  Finding existing settlements with [Stores|Store Component], [Contracts], and [Work Parties] will give citizens to trade the goods and labor they specialize in for the specialties of others, achieving their individual goals faster than if they had each worked alone.  
As you take on new projects that require materials or labor you don't yourself have the ability to create or perform, you can instead sell the goods and services you can perform on the market, by creating stores and setting prices in a [Currency] of your choice. Using this currency to purchase the goods and services of others will then allow you to reach those goals without having to learn everything yourself.

As you build up your capabilities and have more needs of other citizens, you can create your own stores, contracts, and work parties to seek their aid.  As you acquire wealth, your power to effect change (both good and bad) rises.
 
279;The most efficient way to progress in knowledge and technology is trade within the economy.
280;While a functioning society is necessary to stop the meteor, each individual must have their own needs met, starting with food and shelter.
 
281;Choosing a Settlement
282;When choosing a location to settle in, you'll want to consider the following factors:
283;Proximity to Resources
Natural food sources and building supplies nearby will greatly speed up initial progress.

Proximity to Others
Setting up near other settlements offers a distinct advantage, as you can then trade with others to gain progress faster.  However, an overcrowded area may also have limited options for expansion and natural food in the vicinity. You'll want to find a balance based on personal preference.
  
284;Claiming Your Plot
285; Once you've selected a place to build your first settlement, you'll want to claim [Property] around it.  When placing your starting tent this will automatically occur, and further property can be claimed with land papers.  Property you claim will be protected from other citizens, unless you give them access.
286;食物
287;Finding a food supply is critical to having the calories you need to work.  Additionally, the [Nutrition] of the food you eat impacts how fast you gain experience, so you'll want to eat the best food available for the fastest gains.  When settling in the wilderness, look for food sources nearby you can take from, or plan to setup a [Farm|Farming].  When settling near an existing village, have a look at the local economy to see what you can [Trade] in order to get food.
288;Setting up a source of food and shelter is a first priority. 
289;The [Ecosystem|Ecosystem Overview] is the provider of a vast number of resources citizens can make use of, but it also vulnerable to their impact.  Succeeding as a society will require intelligent management of impact, using the [Government|Government Overview] to regulate what is allowed. 
 
Various forms of [Pollution] can affect the environment, creating the potential for catastrophes that could destroy your food supply and halt progress, leading to ecological collapse.  Using [Data] tools, citizens can monitor the impact they're having on the world and use that data to argue for specific regulations to protect it, or accelerate the economy in other avenues.

The world begins as a vast untouched wilderness, and through the ages citizens will need to radically transform it using technology to build the industry and knowledge required to stop [The Meteor].  Citizens will need to execute a careful navigation between using the resources of the ecosystem maximally and avoiding damaging the environment beyond the repair.

290;The ecosystem provides many resources, but is vulnerable to human actions.
291;
  Eco is a world bookended by two threats: Environmental collapse, and the ever-looming [Meteor|The Meteor].
  
To succeed, you'll need to progress through the ages, advancing science and industry to a level that can destroy the meteor without causing ecological collapse in the process.  You will do this as individual member of a larger society, and the creating a positive interplay between individual needs and societal needs is critical to success.  

Your focus in Eco will be on managing your individual progress while simultaneously working to progress the [Economy|Economy Overview] as a whole, and doing so inside a rich [Ecosystem|Ecosystem Overview] of plants and animals that are affected by what you do.  

To aid in creating a positive relationship between this triangle of Individuals, Economy, and Ecosystem, you have the tools of [Government|Government Overview] at your disposal. You can set binding [Laws] that determine what is allowed and run for [Election|Elections] to gain governmental powers to make changes and guide society.

 But first matters first, you'll need to take care of your basic needs before you can save the world.  To do that, you'll start with [Food and Shelter].
292;Your journey in Eco.
293;The world has been given an expiration date, a meteor in a collapsing orbit around the globe, set to collide in 30 real-time days, destroying everything on it in the process.  
  
However, hope is not lost, for with the right technology this crisis can be prevented. By working together to generate a thriving [Economy|economy overview] and advance progress with [Research], humanity has a chance to build the [Laser|LaserItem] needed to destroy this threat.

It will not be an easy task, and the industry required to reach such levels of advancement will pose a real threat to the [Ecosystem|Ecosystem Overview].  To combat this and avoid falling victim to an ecological collapse of your own creation, a well-regulated [Government|Government Overview] must be designed, implemented, and created by its citizens.

The fate of the world depends on its citizens acting together in harmony with the ecosystem to achieve great technological feats, and only through studied collaboration can they succeed.
  
294;A looming threat from above.
295;Through the use of tools, citizens can build great structures and move mountains.  The starting tools will allow you to effect small change only, but as technology advances you will gain tools that can perform batch operations, and eventually [Vehicle|Vehicle Component] that can make massive transformations to the world. 
296;There are a number of different tool types available:
  - [Building] Tools.  Hammers will allow you to place construction materials in 'Forms', shovels allow moving soil.  
  - [Farming] Tools.  Plowing, planting, and sowing all have tools to increase their efficiency.
  - [Transport] Tools.  Vehicles and tools for constructing roads are especially are useful for transporting goods.
  - [Harvesting] Tools.  These tools allow collection of resources from the ecosystem.
  - [Hunting] Tools.  Hunting animals for food requires specialized tools.
  
Tools that are manually powered require Calories, affecting your [Nutrition].
All tools have Durability associated with them, which drops as they are used.  Once a tool has lost its durability, it will take a tremendous amount of calories to use, and should be repaired at a [Repair|Repair Component] Table.
  
297;Having access to the best tools allow you to achieve the most progress.
298;After collecting some basic raw materials, building is one of the first things a citizen will do to establish themselves in the world.
  
  
299;Using a hammer or a crane, citizens can create buildings for homes and industry.
300;
The My Deeds Component allows citizens to see view and manage all [Property] that they own, providing an interface to access them easily.
  
301;Allows citizens to see view and manage all property they own.

The Text Component can be found on Signs, [Vehicles|Vehicle Component], and the [Distribution Station|Item Distribution Component].
  
Text can be useful for giving directions, advertising, or just writing a friendly greeting

For those familar with text markup, a variety of tags may be use to alter the size, color, and formatting of text.

303;Allows citizens write text that is displayed to other citizens.
304;
A foundational goal of the ecosystem simulation in Eco is to contain a multitude of food webs. Food webs can be thought of as a set of 'consumer' and 'consumed' relationships between plants and animals that centers on a particular community of animals and their favorite foods. In general, the idea is to have at least one strong food web present in each biome. Food webs often are the basis of the most important inter and intra-relationships between species in an ecosystem. Many species rely on other species for food, or to hunt the species that is eating them.

Animal's prey and predators can be viewed through the web interface and checking the linked layers. Currently the prey-predator relationship is one way: the predators require the prey to exist, but they don't actually remove any from the simulation. This means that an explosion of elk would increase the wolf population, but this wouldn't put pressure onto the elk. Changing this relationship to consume both ways while ensuring it doesn't spiral out of control in an unexpected and sudden way is important as we move forward.

312;Buildings in Eco
313;
Buildings are divided up into [Rooms] and serve a variety of purposes.

Some of these uses include:

- Making a home filled with furniture to gain bonus [Experience] from housing

- Providing a space for [Crafting] stations to function

- Housing the various [Civic Objects|Civic Object Component] neccesary to establish a government

314;Creating Buildings
315;When carrying a building material, the hammer is able to switch between different block shapes and building patterns.

Citizens build their first homes using a [StoneHammerItem], but as technology progresses increasingly better building tools become available that consume less calorie when used.

Large-scale construction projects can be quickly be completed with the use of a [CraneItem], but at the cost of creating [Pollution].
  
316;Types of Vehicles
317;Types of Civic Objects
318;
Once a [Constitution] is passed, new government policies are contained as Civic Objects in the government building they were created in. There are many types of government buildings, each with their own type of civic object:

- [Laws] are set at a [CourtItem]
- [Demographics] are set at a [CensusBureauItem]
- [Districts] are set at a [ZoningOfficeItem]
- [Elected Titles] are set at a [GovernmentOfficeItem]
- [Civic Articles] are set at a [CapitolItem] or [AmendmentsItem]
- [Election Processes] are set at a [BoardOfElectionsItem]
	
319;Proposing Civic Objects
320;
Clicking the Draft button will allow a citizen to propose a new civic object. Citizens can optionally begin a new draft to a civic object by clicking the Copy button which appears when hovering over the icon.
