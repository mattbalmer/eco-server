Many industrial and housing objects require <b>sewage</b> support to function.  Typically, this means requiring water as an input, and an output for waste water.  Every object that has a [Pipe Component] will need a sewage connection.

Sewage systems are created by connecting a [MechanicalWaterPumpItem] or [ElectricWaterPumpItem] to a water source, and then building <b>Pipes</b> between the different objects that need supplying.  On the waste side, pipes will take the waste water from the object to either dump it into the environment (producing [Pollution] at the exit point), or process it at a [Waster Filter|WasteFilterItem], which will generate [Compost|CompostItem] from the wastewater.

Pipes will automatically connect to any adjacent pipe block of the same type.  To make sewage systems with different pipes in close proximity, use different materials of pipes.
