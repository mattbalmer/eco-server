In Eco, players harvest food initially from the wild biomes around them. Plants ripe for the opportunity to harvest sustainably abound. Wild food sources can serve as a supplementary renewable resource, but will quickly crash if taken advantage of. Some plants will be useful for more than just food-- they may provide chemical compounds that can be found no-where else, or the raw materials needed for textiles and clothing.

Different plants require different tools to harvest, such as a shovel, or a scythe. Other species can be picked by hand without a tool. Similarly, some plants are killed when they are harvested, and others will simply re-grow the picked fruits if they continue to grow and be healthy.
