  Demographics are classes of citizen, created in the government. These can then be used anywhere you can specify a citizen (permissions, laws, etc).

For example, citizens could define a demographic 'Lumberjacks', which would only contain users with a logging skill level of 3 or more.  Then, a law could be created that only permits 'Lumberjacks' to cut down old-growth trees.

Demographics are defined at a [Census Bureau|CensusBureauItem].

Demographics can also have wages set on them. Wages are paid periodically as long as a citizen remains within the demographic.
