    Specialties are unlocked as you level-up from Character [Experience].  Each specialty (represented with a star) will unlock new abilities you can use.

<b>Professions and Specialties</b>
[Professions|Profession Overview] are simply groupings of skills, and donâ€™t serve any other purpose besides storing similar skills together.
Specialties are each contained under a profession and require two steps to gain.

1. First, you must read a skill scroll for the skill.
2. Next, you must spend a star to take the specialty.

Once you have chosen the specialty, you gain the base-level abilities associated with it. As you perform actions related to that specialty, you will gain Specialty [Experience], leveling up the specialty and unlocking new abilities to it.
You can see the spread of specialties that other citizens have chosen on the skill selection dialog, and it is often a good idea to choose specialties that other players have not chosen or leveled up. This will allow you to each perform your own specialties and [Trade] with each other for a net gain.
