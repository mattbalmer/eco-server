    We intend Eco to be a forever-game, growing in depth and breadth and connections to other future games, a system of unlimited possibilities that aims to go beyond entertainment.  This tree contains the past, present, and future of Eco.

    Via our website, you can view all the interactive parts of the tree and see where we're headed and the guiding philosophy behind the game.
