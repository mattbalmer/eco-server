  <section loc="23">The <b>Item Distribution Component</b> allows the owner to provide free items to new citizens, as an act of good will and to boost initial citizen prosperity.</section>
  <section image="IllustrationItemDistribution" loc="24">
All new citizens who qualify (based on how long they have played) can collect their items by visiting the [DistributionStationItem]. Upon entering the world, new citizens will start with a global map marker to alert them that the items are available. Note that the [Storage Component] must remain stocked with the items being distributed to allow new citizens to collect them.

The owner may designate what items are to be distributed, how many of each item, and how recently the citizen must have joined the world to be eligible.
