In the Advanced Settings, <b>requirements</b> for title holders can be set, and <b>hourly wages</b> can be assigned to title holders who qualify.
  
When deciding what is <b>Required of Office Holders</b> a variety of conditions can be set. If a citizen fails to maintain these requirements, they will lose their assignment as a Title User. By using a 'Set of Conditions', multiple requirements can be set for title holders.
 
<b>Wages</b> are paid to Title Users from any [Bank Account|Bank Accounts] that a Title Manager has been given to permission to use in the [Bank Component]. Wages are paid each hour (depending on World settings) into the personal account of each Title User. The Wage Type can be used to exclude offline hours from wage payments.
