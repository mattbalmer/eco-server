Objects that consume fuel will can have fuel input here, and each may require different types of fuel to operate. The tooltips for the accepted fuel contain a list of specific items that can be used to fuel the object. Fuel can also be added from the [Storage Component].

While operating, an object consumes fuel every second, measured in Watts (W). Each type of fuel contains a different amount of potential energy, measured in Joules (J). For every 1 Watt needed per second, 1 Joule of energy is consumed. Fuel is not consumed while the object is inactive.

There are two types of [Power] that can be used by an object, <b>Electric</b> and <b>Mechanical</b>. The <b>power grid</b> displays the type and availability of the needed power for this object. If there is not enough power supply to match the power demanded, objects will become inactive.

Power generators that consume fuel become inactive if there are no nearby objects demanding power. There is no need to turn them on and off to conserve fuel.
