The <b>My Deeds Component</b> allows citizens to see view and manage all [Property] that they own, providing an interface to access them easily.

This component is accessed from a [RealEstateDeskItem]. It provides links to all of the individual deeds that can be accessed by interacting with a [PropertyToolItem] on a deed the citizen owns.

Citizens can quickly rename their deeds, choose a color for that property on the minimap, or provide consumer rights to other citizens, all of which is normally done through the [Authorization Component].

A useful feature of this component is the ability to quickly move plots of property from one deed to another. This includes the option to create a new deed to split an existing piece of property.
