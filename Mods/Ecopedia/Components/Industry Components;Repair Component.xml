After inserting a broken tool, the repair costs will appear. Advanced tools can be repaired for less resources by citizens with the corresponding [Specialty|Specialties]. The resources used can be manually added by a citizen or taken from a linked container in the [Storage Component].

The owner of a Tool Bench can allow other citizens access to repair their own tools for a fee set in the [Credit Component]. When offering tool repair to the public, consumer rights must be given in the [Authorization Component].
