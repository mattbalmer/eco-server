This folder contains user editable .eco files, and provided .eco.template 
files.

The .eco.template files are updated by the developers when new changes to the 
configuration are made. Do not edit these files, as it could affect your 
ability to receive future updates.

To customise your configuration, if a .eco file doesn't already exist copy the 
<Name>.eco.template file and rename it to just <Name>.eco. Then make edits in 
the .eco file. You can also make changes in the server UI.
